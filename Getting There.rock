The road is longer
Papa was a rolling stone


Lovin takes my hope and my strength
Give back my hope with my strength



Growing Up takes my hope and my strength and my focus
If my hope is lower than my focus
Give back my hope with my strength

Give back my hope


Growing Together takes your hope and my strength and your focus
If your hope is higher than your focus
Give back your hope without my strength

Give back your hope
