# foxdot-experiements
stuff and nonsense for performing with foxdot. good stuff will spinoff into its own repo

so far we have a :

* few tests usinmg the early stages of https://github.com/stretchyboy/stems2foxdot
* the start of strapping Rockstar(https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar)  to FoxDot, currently including all of the python from  all of https://github.com/yanorestes/rockstar-py because it imports really badly (must fork the ofiginal code to fix that)
